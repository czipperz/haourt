# HAOURT

**CHMOD and CHOWN is not working, the rest is**

The goal of this project is to easily distribute PKGBUILDs for Arch Linux that install into $HOME.

## Installation

**NOTE THAT IT IS NOT FULLY WRITTEN YET**

Arch Linux:

	curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/czipperz/haourt/master/install | bash

Not for use on non arch systems.

**BUILDING OF PACKAGES MUST BE AS DONE AS THE USER YOU WANT TO INSTALL AS**
